28/04/21 -- 8:47pm :	
(subject to change as I learn more)
trading strategy : 
based on momentum, ma/macd crossover, rsi(divergences&overbought/oversold) and volume (sellVolume on support, buy volume on resistance)

determining entries and exits: 
on MA crossovers, RSI ob/os,

nothing complicated to start with
it'll complexify over time
