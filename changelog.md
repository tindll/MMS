(subject to change as I learn more)
trading strategy :
based on momentum, ma/macd crossover, rsi(divergences&overbought/oversold) and volume (sellVolume on support, buy volume on resistance)

determining entries and exits:
on MA crossovers, RSI ob/os, AND BIGO FIBBO

nothing complicated to start with
it'll complexify over time
