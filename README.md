# MMS
fun project, introduction to algorithmic trading, hopefully tenserflow as well
Trading strategy : based on momentum, ma/macd crossover, rsi(divergences&overbought/oversold) and volume (sellVolume on support, buy volume on resistance)
determining entries and exits: ??? not sure (MAs,ATR?,previous lows)
nothing complicated to start with it'll complexify over time (probably(hopefully(who knows)))

only looking for trades on btc&eth to start

# TODO - 28/04/21
